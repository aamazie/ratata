# ratata
UEFI-encoded RAT attack scanner for headers injections on servers.

Ratata takes in an IP, an Ipv4, which you can modify in the list in the python file. You can add as many as you want but when you run the script it asks how many iterations you want.. default is 100, which is a lot.. these iterations test RAT debug payloads that are in the code.
